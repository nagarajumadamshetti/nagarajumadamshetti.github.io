# Intro

I'm currently a student at NC State University, pursuing my Masters in Computer Science. 

<br>
I'm interested in computer networks and full-stack development. I am a Research Assistant under Dr. Tim Menzies at RAISE Lab. My [project](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1931425&HistoricalAwards=false) explores factors influencing successful computational science software projects, focusing on the importance of quality in software-driven fields. Prior to this I have worked as a Network Software Engineering Intern at Arrcus, where I have  worked on the Arrcus's OS and I have worked on Full Stack development as a Associate Software Development Engineer at West Agile Labs. I am interested in projects with high performance impact. If you think I can be helpful to you or your cause and would like to meet, please feel free to get in touch.
